In the case of South Asian Studies, the challenges of applying DH theories, methods, and technologies include: encoding non-Roman script languages, copyright questions in the creation of archives, the epistemic possibilities of close reading versus distant reading, accessibility of digital products in South Asia, and capturing the complexity of South Asian traditions for teaching and research purposes. A growing cohort of scholars are actively working on these issues and opening pathways for engaging with the history, texts, and practices of South Asia. This symposium will bring together scholars of South Asia working in all four areas of the digital humanities (see Background) to discuss these challenges and the ways forward with the resources at Emory University as our backdrop. The event will also provide Emory faculty, staff, and graduate students with valuable conversation partners, new connections here at the Woodruff Library, and possible collaborators in the expanding field of DH in South Asian Studies.
