In recent years, the digital humanities (DH) have created a shift in scholarly, publishing, and library worlds. Yet there is no clear consensus on what we mean when we use this phrase. What is the digital humanities? What are the digital humanities? As a way of approaching the topic, it is helpful to consider DH as a set of practices comprising four areas. Chris Forster, Assistant Professor in the department of English and Textual Studies at Syracuse University, articulated these areas on HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory) in 2010 as a graduate student at the University of Virginia. They are:

1. Direct, practical uses of computational methods for research
2. Media studies scholars studying “new” media
3. Using technology in the classroom
4. The way new technology is reshaping research and the profession

The first area (Direct, practical uses of computational methods for research) is what many scholars think of when they first try to define the digital humanities. Practices such as text-mining, data visualization, GIS, and mapping, among others are included in this area. The second area (Media studies scholars studying “new” media) is the study of new media (mass communication via digital technologies) and its unequal distribution and impact. The third area (Using technology in the classroom) includes digital pedagogy such as incorporating wikis, Omeka, blogs, or digital storytelling into the classroom setting. The fourth area (The way new technology is reshaping research and the profession) includes questions about academic publishing, the place of libraries as the loci of digital humanities production and archiving, the creation of digital archives, as well as the place of DH in the job market that recent MAs and PhDs enter upon graduation.

While DH has been an important topic among scholars, libraries, and the digital scholarship teams that support such practices, engagement with these practices has been challenging and uneven across disciplines, fields, and geographies. For example, manipulating data for projects that involve text mining presents significant difficulties for languages in non-Roman script. As a result, there are linguistic and geographic concentrations and lacunae in the application of DH theories and methods. Moreover, applying DH technologies in research and teaching requires new technical skillsets beyond the research skills traditionally acquired in academic departments. Many scholars may not incorporate DH in their teaching, and students might have to seek out instruction in these new skills outside of their normal coursework and research. Yet upon completion of the degree, new graduates will confront opportunities for post-docs in DH, for academic careers that require knowledge of DH in relation to research, pedagogy and publishing, and for positions in libraries, museums and presses that also necessitate dexterity with DH applications.

When we consider the distribution of labor between academic departments, libraries, and digital centers like ECDS, we see that libraries have quickly become the ideal locations to support new digital endeavors, to train individuals who are new to DH methods, and to provide resources that support the production of knowledge via DH methodologies.
